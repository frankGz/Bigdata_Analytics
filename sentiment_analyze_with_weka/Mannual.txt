Preprocessing{1-5}, Classification{5}, Predict{6} 

Step 1:
	install required python packages (make sure you have Python3 and pip installed): pip install numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, nltk
	run python in terminal, import nltk, then run script 'nltk.download()' to downlord all extra resources.
Step 2:
	put 'quote-text.py', 'build-dictionary.py', 'train.csv'(downloaded), 'test.csv'(downloaded), 'stop_words.lst'(MODIFIED from downloaded) into a same folder
	open terminal in that folder
Step 3:
	run quote-text.py:	python quote-text.py
	this will generate two files under current folder:	'quoted-train.csv', 'quoted-test.csv'
Step 4:
	run build-dictionary.py:	python build-dictionary.py
	this will generate three files under current folder:	'vectorized-train.csv', 'vectorized-test.csv'(CONTAINS A FAKE CLASS COLUMN), 'words_dictionary.txt'(for inspect, contains list of words as attributes)
Step 5:
	Use weka tools, convert 'vectorized-train.csv', 'vectorized-test.csv' into 'vectorized-train.arff', 'vectorized-test.arff'
Step 6:
	Load 'vectorized-train.arff', remove ID, do classification using a learning algorithm.
Step 7:
	Change 'Test Option' to 'Supplied test set', load 'vectorized-test.arff'
	Re-evaluate the model learned in Step 5 on current test
