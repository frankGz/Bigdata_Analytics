Amy Grant,Christmas Can't Be Very Far Away,/a/amy+grant/christmas+cant+be+very+far+away_20007598.html,"Little bits of heaven  
Floating gently by the window  
Soon this dirty city will be  
Covered with a new snow  
  
Let's put on our winter boots  
Go outside and play  
Christmas can't be very far away  
  
Weather girl says bundle up  
It's gonna be a cold one  
I'll put on my wooly hat  
You'll wear your dad's old Stetson  
  
Pretty lights are everywhere  
Shining night and day  
Christams can't be very far away  
  
Let's take a walk downtown and  
Go dream shopping in the mall  
The kids can do the Santa thing  
Photographs and all  
  
We'll get the biggest tree this year  
And trim it to the top  
And spend a whole lot more  
Than what we've got  
But so what  
  
Come next spring  
I know we will be  
Ready for the sunshine  
Right now throwin' snowballs  
At each other's such a fun time  
  
Kids will think we're crazy  
For awhile and that's okay  
Christmas can't be very far away  
Christmas can't be very far away

What I wanna do and what I really think,  
Time to flow out  
Be a little inappropriate  
'Cause I know that everybody's thinkin' it  
When the lights out  
  
Shame on me  
To need release  
Uncontrollably  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I wanna go all the way  
Taking out my freak tonight  
I wanna show  
All the dirt  
I am running through my mind  
  
Lately people got me all tied up  
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt  
Time to blow out  
I've been told who I should do it with  
To keep both my hands above the blanket  
When the lights out  
  
Shame on me  
To need release  
Uncontrollably

Shame on me (shame on me)  
To need release (to need release)  
Uncontrollably (uncontrollably)

Chris Rea,Hired Gun,/c/chris+rea/hired+gun_20030640.html,"Morning light meet the day  
Nervous eyes look both ways  
And it just won't matter, spring or fall  
There's bread to win and shots to call  
And there ain't nobody out there  
Just a wild uncertainty  
It's in your stride but it ain't no fun  
Sometimes I feel just like a hired gun  
I feel just like a hired gun  
Always on the run  
And how it started, well you can't recall  
Did someone push you, did someone stall  
Whatever the reasons there was lots to learn  
To get home safely and not get burned  
And it's all so cold and empty  
As you watch the setting sun  
You've picked up every dirty trick  
Just to keep yourself always on the run  
And I feel just like a hired gun  
Always on the run  
I dream of comfort and friendship long  
But I can't trust you or anyone  
The scars still hurt me and I don't let them heal  
Each one's a lesson, each one's a shield  
And I may even love you dearly  
And I loathe what I have to do  
You see I've picked up every dirty trick  
In my fear of you  
'cause you make me feel just like a hired gun  
Always on the run

Unpacking winter clothes  
Searching for my hat  
I thought I left it by the door  
So I tore around the room  
Like a bird without a head  
I saw your picture waving back at me  
From underneath the bed  
From a long, long time ago  
  
When all I had  
Was a hat full of stars  
The one I'll always treasure  
The one that you wore  
You loved the look  
But you never looked inside  
You would have seen us there  
You could've seen far  
You should've seen the magic  
In my hat full of stars  
  
I'm trying to live in the present  
But I keep tripping on the past  
Finding out reality, well clarity  
Comes in dribs and drabs  
No we never had the time  
For everything we had  
So it felt like we had nothing  
That's what makes this hat so sad  
It was a long, long time ago  
  
When all we had  
Was a hat full of stars...  
You would have seen us there  
You could've seen far  
You should've seen the magic  
In my hat full of stars  
  
Now whenever I'm alone  
And I think I might forget  
I wear my lucky hat  
Just like a crown up on my head  
'Cause all I have  
Is a hat full of stars...  
If you could see me now  
You would've seen far  
You should've seen the magic  
In my hat full of stars...

He lights every star that makes a darkness bright  
He keeps watch all through each long and lonely night  
He still finds the time to hear a child's first prayer  
Saint or sinner call and always find him there  
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live he'll always say I forgive  
(He can grab a wish or make a dream come true)  
He can paint the clouds and turn the gray to blue)  
He alone knows where to find a rainbow's end  
He alone can see what lies beyond the bend  
He can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold  
He knows every lie that you and I have told  
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live he'll always say I forgive

I think of someone who is gone,  
And the hurtin' starts comin' on real strong,

What makes big old boys like me,  
Get down on bended knee?  
And today's girl who's moving ahead,  
Stay at home all night crying in bed.

Just like some of those good old songs.

Marillion,The King Of Sunset Town,/m/marillion/the+king+of+sunset+town_20088932.html,"A ragged man came shuffling through  
A puppet king on the fourth of June  
And butterflies from all around  
Settled on his paper crown  
  
A pretty sight it seemed to be  
An avenue of eternal peace  
But he said, What is here can soon burn down...  
I'm the king of Sunset Town.  
  
Watch a big wheel turning 'round  
Some go up, and some go down  
Some go thirsty, some just drown  
That's the law 'round here,  
Said the king of Sunset Town  
  
And in the night he comes to me  
And the square becomes a battlefield  
Of staring eyes that can't explain  
The insanity and the greater game  
  
Watch a big wheel turning 'round  
Some go up, and some go down  
Some go thirsty, some just drown  
That's the law 'round here,  
  
Said the king of sunset town  
A ragged man came shuffling through  
The corridors of this white place  
And as he lay his body down  
  
I saw the scars that lined his face  
And injured souls came to his bed  
To hear the stories he would tell  
Of butterflies and summertimes  
  
And everyone assembled here  
Remembers how it used to be  
Before the twenty-seventh came  
This place will never be the same  
  
He said, I'm the king of sunset town.  
Watch a big wheel turning 'round

It's midnight forever in my Jimmy's eyes  
What should it matter if it comes on to spring  
When I'm finding winter in everything  
  
Lived in this cold wind city all of my life  
Walking around still looks the same  
Same people coming and going  
It doesn't feel right - See it all now - From so far away  
  
All of the wisdom that I held so high  
Shining and useless as this April sky  
The hedgerows are singing and it comes on spring  
But I'm finding winter in everything  
  
Lived in this cold wind city all of my life  
Walking around still looks the same  
Same people coming and going  
It doesn't feel right - See it all now - From so far away  
  
So what should it matter if the earth may slide  
Sky break in pieces or the stars collide  
The little of sense left in this world or ours  
My Jimmy took with him in the wee small hours  
  
Lived in this cold wind city all of my life  
Walking around still looks the same

What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again  
Why, must we fly so low?  
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow

Stank love, stank love, stank love, stank love

Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love  
Open up you flower please let me taste your love  
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get ever drip drop on my tongue  
Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do  
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room  
Up and down it seems to go  
Oh my god I think I'm bout to explode  
  
Chorus

My fingertips scan flesh so supple  
No longer a couple like two in one skin  
Where do you end and where do I begin  
Both brains become one mind sensually  
Every nerve becoming it's own individual entity  
With its own lusts, it's own needs to serve  
Longing for the love of all the other nevers  
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction  
In the burning chill of please we bathe  
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave  
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction  
But of creation, elation in the re-making  
No taking in the relation, no taking in the relation  
Just giving of ther persona making lover after making love  
Till ain't nothing but stankonia

She's standing naked and apologizing  
Reaches for her 'till his mind becomes blood hot  
Woken up to be burned, burned, again

Doesn't smile for the child at play  
Thoughts of suicide and alleviation  
Anything to get his heart off of the coals  
Does he fly away or just talk about it  
Like a seagull born to cry in the wind  
All experiences lead to a young girl  
Alone you will meet the one who lies in wait  
Go it alone

When I heard what Father planned to do  
But after I talked to Him

Almost as far from home as you  
I was almost as far from home as you, so

To meet the deeds that I have done

My light must shine along the way  
I'll sing His praise while ages roll  
And strive to help some troubled soul.  
  
The only life that will endure  
Is one that's kind and good and pure  
And so for God I'll take my stand  
Each day I'll lend a helping hand.  
  
I'll help someone in time of need  
And journey on with rapid speed  
I'll help the sick and poor and weak  
And words of kindness to them speak.

I'll try to turn the night to day  
Make flowers bloom along the way.

Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn!  
  
A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell  
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well  
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul  
So get a good hold, yeah  
  
Turn up the night!  
Turn up the night!  
Turn up the night, it feels so right!  
Turn up the night!  
Turn up the night!  
If it feels right  
Turn off the light!  
Turn up the night!

Bob Dylan,I Don't Believe You,/b/bob+dylan/i+dont+believe+you_10043269.html,"I can't understand, she let go of my hand  
An' left me here facing the wall  
I'd sure like to know, why she did go  
But I can't get close to her at all  
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime  
She said she would never forget  
But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here  
She acts like we never met  
It's all new to me like some mystery  
It could even be like a myth  
Yet it's hard to think on that she's the same one  
That last night I was with  
From darkness, dreams are deserted  
Am I still dreamin' yet?  
I wish she'd unlock her voice once an' talk  
'Stead of acting like we never met  
If she ain't feelin' well then why don't she tell  
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?  
Without any doubt, she seems too far out  
For me to return to her chase  
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played  
Her mouth was watery and wet  
But now something has changed for she ain't the same  
She just acts like we never have met  
If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess  
To anything I might've tried  
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong  
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide  
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling  
I remember her whispering yet  
But evidently she don't, evidently she won't  
She just acts like we never have met  
I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way  
Of this I can't say very much  
But if you want me to, I can be just like you  
An' pretend that we never have touched  
An' if anybody asks me, Is it easy to forget?  
I'll say, It's easily done  
You just pick anyone  
An' pretend that you never have met

And the moon comes skimmin' away the stars  
The wind in the mesquite comes rushin' over the hilltops  
Straight into my arms  
Straight into my arms

And a fresh map that I made  
Tonight I'm gonna get birth naked and bury my old soul  
And dance on its grave  
And dance on its grave  
  
It's been a long time comin', my dear  
It's been a long time comin' but now it's here

Somebody I'd see around  
Somebody I'd see around  
  
Now down below and pullin' on my shirt

It'd be that your mistakes would be your own  
Yea your sins would be your own  
  
It's been a long time comin', my dear  
It's been a long time comin' but now it's here  
  
Out 'neath the arms of Cassiopeia  
Where the sword of Orion sweeps  
It's me and you, Rosie, cracklin' like crossed wires  
And you breathin' in your sleep  
You breathin' in your sleep  
  
Well there's just a spark of campfire burning  
Two kids in a sleeping bag beside  
I Reach 'neath your shirt, lay my hands across your belly  
And feel another one kickin' inside  
I ain't gonna fuck it up this time  
  
It's been a long time comin', my dear  
It's been a long time comin' but now it's here

Whenever I kiss you, you never want to lose control, so cold

But now I see that we can't even talk now  
How your love always turned me on  
They're gone, this isn't how I thought love is gonna be

I have tried to save you, but I cannot come to save you  
But this is what you deserve  
This is whta we deserve  
This is something that we have brought upon ourselves  
We are not a victim, you are not a victim  
We are not a victim, you are not a victim  
God will grovel before me.  
God will crawl at my feet.  
These are the dying years.  
These are the dying years.  
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you.

There's a song that's inside of my soul  
It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again  
I'm awake and in the infinite cold  
But You sing to me over and over and over again  
  
So I lay my head back down  
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours  
I pray to be only Yours  
I know You're my only hope  
  
You sing to me of the song of the stars  
Of Your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again  
When it feels like my dreams are so far  
You sing to me of the plans that You have for me over again  
  
And I lay my head back down  
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours  
I pray to be only Yours  
I know You're my only hope  
  
I give You my empathy, I'm giving You all of me  
I want Your symphony singing in all that I am  
At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back  
  
And I lay my head back down  
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours  
I pray to be only Yours, I pray to be only Yours  
I know You're my only hope

Neil Young,Hitchhiker,/n/neil+young/hitchhiker_20099258.html,"When I was a hitchhiker on the road  
I had to count on you  
But you needed me to ease the load  
And for conversation too  
Or judge you, just pass on through.  
  
You didn't see me in Toronto  
When I first tried out some hash  
Smoked through a pen and I'd do it again  
But I didn't have the cash  
I didn't have the cash  
  
Then I tried amphetamines  
And my head was in a glass  
Taped underneath the speedometer wires  
Of my '48 Buick's dash.  
But I knew that wouldn't last.  
  
Then came California  
When I first saw open water  
In the land of opportunity  
I knew I was getting hotter  
I knew I was getting hotter.  
  
But the neon lights  
And the endless nights  
Fame took me by surprise  
The doctor gave me Valium  
But I still couldn't close my eyes  
I still couldn't close my eyes.  
  
Then came paranoia  
And it ran away with me  
I would not sign my autograph  
Or appear on TV  
Or see or be seen  
  
Living in the country  
Looked good to me  
Smoking grass while the summer passed  
In the real organic sea  
Where everything was green  
  
Then we had a kid and we split apart  
I was living on the road  
And a little cocaine went a long, long way  
To ease that different load  
And my head did explode  
My head did explode.  
  
I thought I was an Aztec  
Or a runner in Peru  
I could build such beautiful buildings  
To house the chosen few  
Like an Inca from Peru.  
  
How many years have come and gone  
Like friends and enemies  
I tried leave my past behind  
But it's catching up with me  
It's catching up with me  
  
I don't know how I'm standin' here  
Livin' in my life  
I'm thankful for my children  
And my faithful wife

When the strong young man of the rising sun  
Heard the tolling of the great black bell  
  
One day in the year of the fox

Meant the time had come  
For one to go  
To the temple of the king  
  
There in the middle of the circle he stands  
Searching, seeking  
With just one touch of his trembling hand  
The answer will be found  
  
Daylight waits while the old man sings  
Heaven help me  
And then like the rush of a thousand wings  
It shines upon the one  
And the day had just begun

Came a time remembered well  
When the strong young man of the rising sun

It meant the time had come  
For one to go  
To the temple of the king  
  
There in the middle of the people  
He stands  
Seeing, feeling  
With just a wave of a strong right hand  
He's gone  
To the temple of the king  
  
Far from the circle at the edge of the world  
He's hoping, wondering  
Thinking back from the stories he's heard  
Of what he's going to see  
  
There in middle of the circle it lies  
Heaven help me  
Then all could see by the shine in his eyes  
The answer had been found  
  
Back with the people in the circle  
He stands  
Giving, feeling  
With just one touch of a strong right hand  
They know  
Of the temple and the king

A wheel of fate, a game of chance

A ticking box, in the hand of the innocent

Slayer,Circle Of Beliefs,/s/slayer/circle+of+beliefs_20126124.html,"Can't explain the other side  
Answers lost before their eyes  
Violence surges from inside  
A state of mind that never dies  
Born into a chosen way  
Life that doesn't fit today  
To die a painful death it seems  
Is better than your misery  
Contemplating rearranging  
Changing all your ways of thinking  
  
Everyday your life seems like  
It's pushed into a hole  
Acting out another's needs  
To rule a soul eternally  
Adjusting to another set  
Of values takes its toll  
Growing in a lunacy  
That plays on your stupidity  
  
Circle of beliefs  
Secrets never keep  
Living in a lie  
Right before your eyes  
Born without a brain  
Helpless in your name  
All you do is pray  
Living is your pain  
  
Mentality so small you can't  
Accept another side  
Your point of view a memory  
Because it doesn't mean a thing  
The resurrections waiting for  
A world without a sin  
The temples all will crumble  
While awaiting for it to begin  
  
Circle of beliefs  
Secrets never keep

Must control silencing of souls  
Show decay spreading through your brain  
Devastate the deviant will dominate  
  
Can't you see there's no validity  
Your way is not the only way  
Slow decay is spreading through your brain  
Don't you see the power of the enemy  
Tyranny total supremacy  
Control the silencing of souls  
Slavery within the entity  
Devastate, dominate  
  
Can't explain the reason why  
Someone would rather live than die  
If dying is the only way  
Top end a life of mental sins  
All your life he's been the cause  
A man impaled onto a cross  
Pure religious holocaust  
If religion dies it's not my boss  
  
Perception always biased  
Feeding off a fallacy  
Your systematic way of life  
Decided for you every night  
Intentional conflicting words  
Avoid solidity  
Blinded by the holy light  
That constantly consumes your mind

Townes Van Zandt,For The Sake Of The Song,/t/townes+van+zandt/for+the+sake+of+the+song_20139914.html,"Why does she sing  
Her sad songs for me,  
I'm not the one  
To tenderly bring  
Her soft sympathy  
I've just begun  
To see my way clear  
And it's plain,  
If I stop I will fall  
I can lay down a tear  
For her pain,  
Just a tear and that's all.  
  
What does she want me to do?  
She says that she knows  
That moments are rare  
I suppose that it's true  
Then on she goes  
To say I don't care,  
And she knows  
That I do  
  
Maybe she just has to sing, for the sake of the song  
And who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong.  
  
She'd like to think that I'm cruel,  
But she knows that's a lie  
For I would be  
No more than a tool  
If I allowed her to cry  
All over me.  
  
Oh my sorrow is real  
Even though  
I can't change my plan  
If she could see how I feel  
Then I know  
That she'd understand  
  
Oh does she actually think I'm to blame?  
Does she really believe  
That some word of mine  
Can relieve  
All her pain?  
Can't she see that she grieves  
Just because she's been blindly deceived  
By her shame?  
  
Nothin's what it seems,  
Maybe she'll start someday  
To realize  
If she abandons her dreams,  
Then all the words she can say  
Are only lies  
When will she see  
That to gain  
Is only to lose?  
All that she offers me  
Are her chains,  
I got to refuse  
  
Oh but it's only to herself that she's lied  
She likes to pretend  
It's something that she must defend,  
With her pride  
And I don't intend  
To stand her and be the friend  
From whom she must hide

To look for him  
If Jesus comes around again  
  
I'll cry I'll cry  
I'll cry for help  
I'll let you be the one  
To try to redeem the sins of man  
One day before Easter comes  
But I won't let Jesus find me

Hide from him  
Hide myself but not the sin  
I'm gonna hide  
Hide from him  
Hide myself but no the sin  
If Jesus comes around again  
I've got the rock the needle  
The bottle of sorrow  
And Jesus Jesus Jesus knows

For sum reason though they hate it to death  
The love's gone only hatred is left  
Only achin' and stress  
A king not be mistaken for less  
And this here is for the taking  
This is history in the making  
  
Where I'm from it's kinda hard to trust  
Cause the hate's from most of your own people  
They're fake and they're all see through  
Hate to see a nigga when he's stackin' his bucks  
Rather him be down in the dumps  
And out on his luck  
But I'll be damned if my grind stop  
My mind tickin' like the time watch  
And I'm gon be spittin' 'till the time's not  
Presently there  
I touch minds everywhere  
And I'll ride hopin' heaven is near  
See the pain in your eyes young wit every stare  
I seek peace, but these streets will never be fair  
Cause somebody went and took Greg's life  
Son reached  
Deceased  
No time to blink or think twice damn  
Wonder when it gonna be my time  
To meet death  
I'm stressed need to ease my mind  
And unless one of y'all try to see whats mine  
Then I'll eat through your flesh, bones and leave that spine  
U see I did the right thing  
I stayed up out the gun and knife game  
I knew about the pain it might bring  
And we all got problems  
I chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em  
The top, but I rose from the bottom  
And I'm here now  
Ain't no body harming young  
My screw's loose they say somethings wrong wit young  
Ya time's up I'm just warning young  
Cause this here's for the taking,  
This is history in the making

Xavier Rudd,Anni Kookoo,/x/xavier+rudd/anni+kookoo_20823811.html,"The places that we live and the living that we did  
The places we were put and the things we were given  
He sings what they talk  
But they took away are pride but they didn't take our lives  
They took away the things that made us feel alive  
Said, Ooh ooh, what have we become?  
What have we become?  
Said, Ooh ooh, how did this become?  
How did this become? How did this become?  
In old woman we flex from the East to the West  
She thinks of her grandmother and her grandfather  
And strings that they had  
Now she looks to the arm, saw them sniffing on their drugs  
The drink in there has stolen so many souls  
And flooded her sacred blood  
She says, Ooh ooh, what have we become?  
What have we become?  
She says, Ooh ooh, how did this become?  
How did this become?  
She says, Ooh ooh, the bottle took away my son  
It took away my son  
She says, Ooh ooh, where are we gonna run?  
What have we become?  
She says, Ooh ooh, what have we become?  
What have we become?  
She says, Ooh ooh, how did this become?  
How did this become?  
She says, Ooh ooh, see the bottle took away my son  
It took away my son  
She says, Ooh ooh, where are we gonna run?  
What have we become?

Zebrahead,Hell Yeah!,/z/zebrahead/hell+yeah_20754557.html,"Hell yeah, woo  
Punk rock trippin' with the flavor of hip hop  
Spittin' out venom as I'm watching all your heads bob  
Representing for the outcasts and the have nots  
Feigning to find light in a world that has blacked out  
Your middle fingers up, yeah, put 'em up, we've had enough  
We take a shot to the chin with a grin, we're tough  
We know exactly why you're here so make it clear, let's go  
We know you want to let's go, let's go  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, we want control  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, a scene to call our own  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, I grip the microphone  
And we're picking up speed like a rolling stone  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Rising from the ash, counter clash, there is no doubt  
Swinging from the rafters are the kids who never sold out  
Holding out for hope, this shit is dope, hear the crowds shout  
Fighting to survive, one day we'll make them tap out  
We'll raise your voices up, yeah, raise 'em up, we've had enough  
We're standing up and now we're being heard the gloves are off  
The voice is loud, we have the crowd, the time is now, let's go  
We know you want to let's go, let's go  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, we want control  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, a scene to call our own  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, I grip the microphone

So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Get up tonight, stand up and fight  
They are here, they are in sight, they're inside  
And I can't go alone on this microphone  
Is this on? Is this on?  
This flow is definitive, make your throat hurt  
A gagged voice with no choice, it's so limited  
Hell yeah, come on, hell yeah, it's on  
Bounce to the boom of the beat of the drum, drum  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?
