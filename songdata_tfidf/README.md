Songdata Analyze
##Text Analytics using Python
* Descriptive Statistics
	*  number of artists/bands in the collection (numOfArtists)
	*  number of songs in the collection (numOfSongs)
	*  average number of songs per artist/band (avgNumOfSongs)
	*  average number of unique words per song in the collection (avgNumOfWords)
	*  average number of unique words per song of an artist/band, sorted by artist/band name in an alphanumerically ascending order, i.e., a->z (pairsOfArtistAvgNumOfWords)
	*  plot a bar chart that shows the top-10 pairs found in the previous bullet, where the x-axis represents the artists/band and the y-axis represents the average number of words.
* Creating Profiles of Songs and Artists
	*  songprofiling.py: Given a collection of English songs, it computes and prints out (in the STDOUT) the profile of each song in the collection; the profile of a song consists of the top-50 more important words of its lyrics, based on the tf-idf score. Before printing out, you need to sort the pairs of (word, score) in descending order of score.
	*  artistprofiling.py: Given a collection of English songs, it computes and prints out (in the STDOUT) the profile of each artist/band in the collection; the profile of an artist/band consists of the top-100 more important words of their song lyrics, based on the tf-idf score. Before printing out, you need to sort the pairs of (word, score) in descending order of score.
* Comparing Songs and Artists
	*  songsim.py: Given a collection of English songs, it computes and prints out (in the STDOUT) the similarity between two songs in the collection. It determines the similarity between two songs by computing the Jaccard index of their profiles (re-use the song profile of Question B).
	*  artistsim.py: Given a collection of English songs, it computes and prints out (in the STDOU) the similarity between two artists in the collection. It determines the similarity between two artists by computing the Jaccard index of their profiles (re-use the artist/band profile of Question B).
