1. one of the idea I used to count the frequency is
   first preprocess and get the total count of grams (by the natual of n-grams you can just calculate
   total word count per file and minus n-1 to get total count of grams of that file)
   could use map reduce to process, in each mapper, count the number of n gram and output it as value, 
   with the same key so it goes to the same reducer, reducer get the total number of term, then do actual processing
   for the actual processing, the value will be 1 devided by total number of grams instead of 1.
